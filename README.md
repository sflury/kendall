# kendall
Calculate non-parametric correlation coefficient Kendall's tau, accounting for censoring (upper/lower limits),
based on the two-variable correlation formalism of Akrita & Siebert. 1996. MNRAS 278, 919-924.
Additional function is included to determine the sensitivity of the correlation coefficient 
to individual datum (done by bootstrapping) and/or uncertainties in the data (done by Monte Carlo sampling).

While this code is provided publicly, I request that any use thereof be cited in any publications in which this 
code is used. For this purpose, the zenodo DOI is listed below as well as a BibTeX reference.
This script was initially developed, implemented, and tested for work presented in Flury et al. 2022 ApJ 930, 126.

## Example Usage
``` python
from kendall import *
# gen random data
np.random.seed(123)
x = np.random.rand(89)
y = x+0.1*np.random.randn(len(x))
# gen random "upper limits"
censors = np.ones((2,len(x)))
uplims = np.unique(np.random.randint(0,high=len(x)-1,size=60))
censors[1,uplims]=0
uncens = [i for i in range(len(x)) if i not in uplims]
# faux uncertainties, accounting for upper limits
x_err = 0.1*np.random.rand(len(x))*censors[0]
y_err = 0.1*np.random.rand(len(y))*censors[1]
# Kendall tau
tau,p = kendall(x,y,censors=censors)
tau_lo,tau_up = tau_conf(x,y,censors,method='bootstrap')
print(f'censored Kendall tau: {tau:.3f}-{tau_lo:.3f}+{tau_up:.3f}, p: {p:.3e}')
```
which prints the following to the command line
```
censored Kendall tau: 0.465-0.018+0.018, p: 1.094e-10
```
